<p>Hi, my name is Hayley Hunt.</p>
<p>I am a fourth and final year PhD student at The University of Hong Kong.</p>

# Get to Know Me 

### My Portfolio Website
<p align="center">
<a href="https://www.hayley-hunt.com"></a>Website</p>
  <p>I built the site in HTML and CSS. I believe web-application design is a useful tool that helps me as a data analyst present my findings and insights in an accessible, clear and organized way. This permits sharing of my work easily through a company intranet, or publicly available on a company website. Though I did learn a lot from making this website, much of the joy that came from this project was found making something of my own and putting it out into the world.</p>

# My Professional Experience
  <p align="center">
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayleyhunt/">LinkedIn</a></p>
  <p>For the past 3 years I have been working full-time towards my PhD in Geology at The University of Hong Kong. I have been able to gain much experience in data generation, manipulation/extraction, and visualisation.</p>
  
### Himalayan River Network Response To Progressive Himalayan Uplift, PhD project (2022-present)
<p>
  • Creating landscape evolution numerical models of the Himalaya using FastScape and xarray-simlab, implemented in Python.
  • Aggregrating and visualising data using numpy, pandas and matplotlib to understand model behaviour by presenting different aspects of the model including river profiles and changes in topography through time.
  • Calibrating model outputs to reality by creating a misfit function and validated the model using multiple independent datasets including thermochronologic, GPS, and cosmogenic nuclide data.
</p>

### Himalayan Biotic Response To Progressive Mountain Uplift, PhD project (2020-present)
<p>
  • Utilising the DECX (Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis eXtended) numerical model to estimate ancestral areas of different species located in the Himalaya at present-day with dated phylogenies, present-day species distribution, and time-stratified paleogeographic matrices.
  • Aggregrating and visualising data in Python using numpy, pandas and matplotlib to show species migration into and out of regions of the Himalaya during their formation.
</p>

### The Influence of Earth’s Mantle Flow on Himalayan Uplift, PhD project (2022-present)
<p>
  • Completing novel analogue and digital modelling of mantle convection as a driver of India-Eurasia continental convergence and tectonic slab break-off and its impact on Himalayan topography.
  • Conducting photogrammetry and laser acoustic imaging of the surface throughout model runs and visualised changes in (paleo)topography using Agisoft Metashape and CloudCompare.
  • Aggregrating and visualising data in Python using numpy, pandas and matplotlib to show tectonic plate shortening, thickening, and to create deformation maps tracking displacement and strain within the plates.
