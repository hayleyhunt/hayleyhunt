<p>Hi, my name is Hayley Hunt.</p>
<p>I am a fourth and final year PhD student at The University of Hong Kong.</p>

# Get to Know Me 

## My Website
<p align="center">
<a href="https://www.hayley-hunt.com">Website</a></p>
  <p>I built the website in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I believe web-application design is a useful tool that helps me as a data analyst present my findings and insights in an accessible, clear and organized way. This permits sharing of my work easily through a company intranet, or publicly available on a company website. Though I did learn a lot from making this website, much of the joy that came from this project was found making something of my own and putting it out into the world.</p>

## My Professional Experience
  <p align="center">
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayleyhunt/">LinkedIn</a></p>
  <p>For the past 3 years and until August 2024 I have been working full-time towards my PhD in Geology at The University of Hong Kong. I have been able to gain much experience in data generation, manipulation/extraction, and visualisation.</p>

## My PhD Projects

### Himalayan River Network Response To Progressive Himalayan Uplift, PhD project (2022-present)
<p>
  • Creating landscape evolution numerical models of the Himalaya using <a href="https://fastscape.org">FastScape</a> and <a href="https://xarray-simlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">xarray-simlab</a>, implemented in Python.</br>
  • Running multiple models over a complex search space to find the optimal hyperparameters via distributed computing using the <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/mango">Mango</a> hyperparameter tuning library.</br>
  • Aggregrating and visualising data using numpy, pandas and matplotlib to understand model behaviour by presenting different aspects of the model including river profiles and changes in topography through time.</br>
  • Calibrating model outputs to reality by creating a misfit function and validated the model using multiple independent datasets including thermochronologic, GPS, and cosmogenic nuclide data.
</p>

### Himalayan Biotic Response To Progressive Mountain Uplift, PhD project (2020-present)
<p>
  • Utilising the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/038695v1">DECX</a> (Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis eXtended) numerical model to estimate ancestral areas of different species located in the Himalaya at present-day with dated phylogenies, present-day species distribution, and time-stratified paleogeographic matrices.</br>
  • Aggregrating and visualising data in Python using numpy, pandas and matplotlib to show species migration into and out of regions of the Himalaya during their formation.
</p>

### The Influence of Earth’s Mantle Flow on Himalayan Uplift, PhD project (2022-present)
<p>
  • Completing novel analogue and digital modelling of mantle convection as a driver of India-Eurasia continental convergence and tectonic slab break-off and its impact on Himalayan topography.</br>
  • Conducting photogrammetry and laser acoustic imaging of the surface throughout model runs and visualised changes in (paleo)topography using Agisoft Metashape and CloudCompare.</br>
  • Aggregrating and visualising data in Python using numpy, pandas and matplotlib to show tectonic plate shortening, thickening, and to create deformation maps tracking displacement and strain within the plates.
</p>

<p>
  Please note that these projects are currently unpublished and so the associated code is not yet publicly available on my GitHub. The code for these projects will be made publicly available once the projects are published.
</p>

## My Personal Projects
<p>
    • Web scraping using <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io">Selenium</a> of data from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WOWPresents">WOWPresents YouTube channel</a>.</br>
    • Data Analysis and visualization of the number of views of different video types, countries, US and All Star seasons, and queens of RuPaul's Drag Race and WowPresents YouTube channels. Find the project <a href="https://github.com/hayleyhunt/rupaulsdragrace_youtube/tree/main">here</a>.</br>
